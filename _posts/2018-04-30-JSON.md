# Better data management and servo control

The idea behind this experiment was to try to automate the acquisition using a servo, and to have a better way of structuring the data.
* Data is now stored using a JSON.
* Servo is controled by an arduino, pushing geometrical details onto a SPI line using the 2 bits per sample free (used for a turn counter)

[Detail of the experiment is here](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/experiments/auto/20180430a.md)
