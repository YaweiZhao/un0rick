# Nunc Ille Est Magicus -- Introduction

Non destructive testing and imaging ultrasound modalities have been around since the '50s in . More and more ultrasound-based initiative are emerging, mostly focusing on image processing - while hardware has been left behind. Several teams have produced succesful designs for the different possible uses, mostly efforts from research laboratories. Most have been used on commercial US scanners, traditionaly used as experiment platforms, but they are not cheap, and yield very little in terms of data access and control. Others have been developped in labs, but, sadly, very few have been open-sourced. This particular project stems from a previous beaglebone-based design, as well as an arduino-like module-based design. 

It has also been shown that simple (be it low-power, low-cost and small) can be achieved - and this, even for relatively complex systems, based on 16 to 64  parallel   channels   front-end  processing and software back-end processing (embedded PC or DSP). This makes it a bit more complex for the layman, hobbyist, or non-specialist researcher to use, not to mention the very little information that is accessible.

# Quia Ego Sic Dico -- installation steps

1. Setup
2. Install the image on the Raspberry 
3. Burn bitstream
4. Acquire the signal
5. Process and display!
